# Android Codelabs
Android Codelabs are exercises that are a part of the [Android Basics in Kotlin](https://developer.android.com/courses/android-basics-kotlin/course?authuser=1) course. This repo is a collection of notes and other helpful insights related to the aforementioned course. 

## Version Control
Updated [.gitignore](https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/master/Android.gitignore) to ignore irrelevant files. We also have to run `git rm --cached -r .` so that git tracks/untracks files according to our new `.gitignore` file, this is because previously tracked files are not removed just because we added them to `.gitignore`.
